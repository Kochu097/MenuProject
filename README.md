## Concept
I created an API in **Java Spring-Boot**, that connects **MySQL** database and Frontend written in **React**. <br/><br/>
I have also configure CI pipeline to test my application each time I'm about to merge to the main branch. I'm also planning to implement CD pipeline once the app is ready for the first deployment.<br/><br/>
The purpose of the app is to help common household in meal planning for multiple people, and creating a simple shoping list, that you can print or take with you to the store.<br/><br/>
For the future I want to apply also connection to the 3rd party api to gather data about available products and recipies. That also includes caching the results from that API to limit the amount of calls, for budgeting purposes.<br/><br/>
I also wanted to add AI option for premium users. That API will gather all info about meals and products and suggest the meal plan for the week.<br/><br/>
Another planned feature is gathering nutrition data, to also optimise meal plan for people with special needs.<br/><br/>
